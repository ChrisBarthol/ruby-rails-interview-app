# Superior Construction
We here at Superior Construction hired an intern this summer to develop a web application for us to use. Our business is hyper-local thought leadership driven construction and having this web application finished would be a huge help.

The three main areas that we need are Projects, Materials and Workers/Personnel. The first two, Projects and Materials, are definitely the most important and should be done first. We would like to be able to add/remove/modify projects along with adding, removing and/or modifying the materials required for each project.

A bonus would be to add functionality to add personnel to each project with a listing of who is on what project along with those personnel that are currently free to be added onto a project (with the ability to add/remove personnel in general as well as add/remove them from projects.

We have included some CSV files that we're currently using to keep track of our projects and materials that you can use to fill up the web application with.

Good Luck!
